/**
 * POST /api/webhooks/twilio
 *
 * Where an inbound text becomes either a phone registration or a comment reply.
 *
 * The order of checks matters, and it is explicit rather than incidental:
 *
 * 1. The Twilio signature is verified over the raw form parameters before
 *    anything is trusted.
 * 2. A body matching a live verification code is a registration. This is checked
 *    first because a sender with no verified number cannot own a thread — the
 *    ordering would fall out anyway, but relying on that would be an accident.
 * 3. Otherwise it is a reply, attributed by sender number and attached by
 *    last-thread-wins.
 *
 * ## The trust model here is weaker than the email path, on purpose
 *
 * An emailed reply carries a per-(thread, user) token in the recipient address:
 * unguessable, issued to one person for one thread, and the reason the email
 * handler never has to trust the `From:` header. An SMS gives you a sender
 * number, our number, and a body. There is nowhere to hide a token, so **the
 * credential is the sender's phone number.**
 *
 * Twilio validates the originating number, so this is not nothing — but it is
 * the opposite of the "never trust the sender" rule the email path documents,
 * and it inherits every weakness of the phone network: SIM swap, number
 * recycling, and spoofing on some routes.
 *
 * This repository is a reference implementation. Somebody will copy whichever
 * pattern they read, so read this one knowing what it gives up.
 *
 * ## Last-thread-wins is ambiguous, and that is the accepted cost
 *
 * A reply attaches to the most recent thread the sender was notified about. If
 * two mentions land close together the reply may attach to the wrong one. The
 * alternatives all cost more than the ambiguity: a number per thread does not
 * scale, and a code in the body breaks the "just reply" promise that makes this
 * feature worth having. The outbound message names the document so the reader has
 * the context to notice.
 *
 * ## Canonicalisation happens here, not later
 *
 * A phone number enters the system at this boundary — both `User.phone` and
 * `PhoneVerificationAttempt.phone` are keyed on whatever string arrives in
 * `From`. Twilio's webhook guarantees `From` is E.164 (`+15551234567`) for
 * numbers it can identify, so no normalisation step runs here: the value is
 * used as-is. If Twilio ever delivers a non-E.164 `From` (short codes and some
 * alphanumeric sender IDs are the known exceptions), it would silently fail to
 * match a previously-registered number rather than erroring, so that
 * assumption is recorded here rather than left implicit.
 */

/**
 * Escape text for inclusion in an XML element.
 *
 * **A raw `&` makes the whole TwiML document unparseable, and the failure is
 * silent from this side.** Twilio parses the response as XML; if that parse
 * fails it sends nothing at all, while this route has already returned 200 and
 * already written to the database. So the app believes it replied, the handset
 * receives nothing, and the only evidence is a `12200` in Twilio's alerts log
 * that nothing here surfaces.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: registering a number in production on 2026-09-14
 * produced exactly that, because `REGISTERED_MESSAGE` carries "Msg&data rates
 * may apply". It had worked in September only because the copy then contained
 * no ampersand; centralising the program copy added the rates disclosure and
 * broke every reply carrying one, without a single test noticing.
 *
 * The messages are filed with the A2P campaign and pinned by
 * `lib/a2p-filing.test.ts`, so the text cannot be changed to suit the encoding.
 * The encoding has to handle the text — which is the right way round anyway.

/**
 * The URL Twilio signed. It signs the address it was configured with, so behind a
 * proxy the request's own view of the URL can differ; `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_URL` pins
 * it when they disagree.
 *
 * **A blank value must be treated as unset, and `??` does not do that.**
 * `.env.production` documents this name with an empty assignment, and Next loads
 * that file in the production runtime, so the variable arrives as `''` rather
 * than `undefined`. Nullish coalescing kept the blank, and the signature was
 * then computed over an empty string — which does not weaken the check, it
 * breaks it outright: the HMAC never matches, so production answered 403 to
 * every inbound message. STOP, HELP, verification codes and replies all failed
 * silently, and from outside the webhook looked like it was correctly rejecting
 * forgeries.
 *
 * This is the same failure that took out every document route in #19. The rule
 * it cost twice to learn: when a variable is documented by empty assignment,
 * fall back on falsiness, not on nullishness.
