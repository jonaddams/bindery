 * Working out who a comment mentions.

 *
 * A comment written in the viewer carries the SDK's own mention list, which we
 * pass through as `customData.mentions`. That list is exact: it holds the user
 * IDs the author actually picked from the mention menu.
 *
 * A comment that arrived by email has no `customData` at all — somebody typed
 * `@bob` into their mail client. All we can do is match the text against the
 * directory, and that matching is deliberately conservative: an `@` token has to
 * resolve to a known user's email address or its local part, or it is ignored.
 * Display names are not matched, because they contain spaces and guessing where
 * a name ends produces false positives that email people who were never mentioned.
