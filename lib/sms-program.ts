 * 2. the examples published at https://jonaddams.com/sms (rendered from
 *    `LEGAL` in the `nutrient-sdk-samples` repo), and
 * 3. what this application actually sends.
 *
 * The campaign's first submission was rejected on its Call-to-Action check with
 * several of these disagreeing at once — the published page named a host that
 * did not resolve, published a number the account no longer sent from, and
 * showed a `Bindery:` prefix the code never produced. Scattering the strings
 * across call sites is what let them drift, so they live here instead: changing
 * one is now a visible edit to a file whose whole purpose is to say they must
 * match the filing.
 *
 * If you change any string here, update the published page and re-file the
 * campaign's sample messages in the same change.
