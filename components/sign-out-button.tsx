 * Deliberately a button rather than a link. BetterAuth's sign-out endpoint is
 * `POST /api/auth/sign-out`, where NextAuth's was a GET page at
 * `/api/auth/signout`. Three pages carried an anchor to that old GET URL, so the
 * auth migration broke sign-out everywhere without breaking a build or a test —
 * a hardcoded URL is invisible to a search for `next-auth` imports. Routing this
 * through the client keeps the method right and keeps the URL out of the markup,
 * so the next auth change cannot repeat it.
